## How to Deploy with GitHub Pages

You can host this application for free using GitHub Pages. Here's how:

1.  **Go to your repository's settings.** Click on the "Settings" tab at the top of your repository page.
2.  **Navigate to the "Pages" section.** In the left sidebar, click on "Pages".
3.  **Choose a source.** Under "Build and deployment", select "Deploy from a branch" as the source.
4.  **Select the branch.** Under "Branch", select the `main` (or `master`) branch and keep the folder as `/ (root)`.
5.  **Save your changes.** Click "Save".
6.  **Your site is live!** After a few moments, your site will be published at `https://<your-username>.github.io/<your-repository-name>/`. You'll see the URL on the same "Pages" settings page.

That's it! Your GameShare app is now live and accessible to everyone.
